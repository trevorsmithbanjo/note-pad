# note-pad

## Description
![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)<br>
This application is for a user looking to be able to take notes and have them stored so when they come back they can read their notes they saved. The app is built with node.js and express.js in the back end and stores notes in a JSON file. The app alows the user to delete notes when they are no longer needed as well.

## Installation
Once you have downloaded all of the folders from this repo you can run ```npm install``` to install all of the dependencies.

## Usage
If you are running the application locally you will need to go to the directory where the files are stored and run 
```
npm start
```
to start the server.<br>
